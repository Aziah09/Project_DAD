## Middleware Functions/Features

The middleware performs several key functions to facilitate communication and data processing between the applications:

- **Authentication**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Data Transformation**: Transforms data between different formats required by the applications.
- **Logging**: Logs important events and errors for monitoring and debugging.
- **Caching**: Improves performance by caching frequent requests.
